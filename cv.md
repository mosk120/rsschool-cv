My last language practice was in Netherlands
I used to work in the UK for half of a year and 4 months in Netherlands where I used English on a daily basis and even some German and Dutch.
I have finished  English courses in Warsaw and practised some English with my American teacher for a few months. I was practicing English with my foreign friends in Warsaw.
